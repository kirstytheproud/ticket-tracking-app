# Ticket Tracking App
This is an app for keeping track of tickets for a whole dev team.
Initially it was a simple app created to help my learn and understand one of the most fundamental React hooks: useState. At first, I created a simple counter that utilises useState, using team data to create individual employee cards.

As I became more confident with React I decided to improve and build upon the simple counter app to incorporate more functionality. To add more complexity, I wanted to be able to add a "To-Do List" type of functionality to each individual employee. This way, to simulate a real-life dev team, each team member can see and keep track of what tickets and tasks their colleagues are working on.

I created a Form and ToDoList component in order to create this task creator, whilst learning about the React hook useContext and Context API. This allows the user to add tasks and create a task list. The user is also able to delete tasks.

I wanted to create a drag and drop functionality in order to allow the user to rearrange tasks according to priority. I did this using react-beautiful-dnd.
